                <p>Photography is an art of visual editing. At bottom, it is a matter of surrounding with a frame a
                    portion of one's cone of vision, while standing in the right place at the right time. Like chess, or
                    writing, it is a matter of choosing from among given possibilities, but in the case of photography
                    the number of possibilities is not finite but infinite.</p>

                <p> A photograph reminds you little things long after you have forgotten everything. It stops the moment
                    from running away of your memories.</p>

                <p>To us photography is about people being real and then letting us paint a picture of that moment to
                    remember it forever. This is the story that matters most: real people, real stories, real moments.
                </p>

                <p>We are incredibly blessed to have a team of photographers who work with us on any given weekend.
                    Please take a few minutes to get to know us.

                    We would love to visit with you by phone or in person and talk about your wedding, event, portrait
                    session or video project. Please reach out to us through the Contact Page.</p>
